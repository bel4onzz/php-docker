    <h2>Brief code review</h2>
    <div>
        <h4>Complex Logic in ageByOneDay Method:</h4>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The ageByOneDay method has complex nested conditional statements that make it difficult to read and maintain.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Duplicated Code:</h4>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px;">There are several blocks of code that are repeated for different item types, especially regarding the updates to value and sellIn. This violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Missing Type Declarations:</h4>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The properties $name, $value, and $sellIn lack explicit types.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Method Naming Consistency:</h4>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The name() and value() methods are ambiguous as they could imply an action rather than a getter.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Encapsulation Violation via Direct Property Exposure:</h4>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Exposing the properties through methods like name() and value() without control may violate encapsulation principles.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Violation of the Single Responsibility Principle:</h4>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px;">
            The ageByOneDay method is responsible for multiple actions: calculating the new value based on the item type, modifying the sellIn value, and handling different conditions for various items. 
            This can lead to difficulties in testing and maintaining the code.
